# Used Car Price Prediction

This repository contains the code and data for predicting the price of used cars using various regression models including Linear Regression, RandomForestRegressor, DecisionTreeRegressor, Ridge, and Lasso.

Description

This project aims to predict the selling price of used cars based on several features. The models implemented include Linear Regression, RandomForestRegressor, DecisionTreeRegressor, Ridge, and Lasso. By training these models on historical car data, we aim to provide accurate predictions for future car prices.

Features

The dataset includes the following features:

Car_Name: Name of the car (object)

Year: Year of manufacture (int64)

Selling_Price: Price at which the car is being sold (float64)

Present_Price: Current ex-showroom price of the car (float64)

Kms_Driven: Number of kilometers the car has driven (int64)

Fuel_Type: Type of fuel used by the car (object)

Seller_Type: Type of seller (object)

Transmission: Transmission type (object)

Owner: Number of previous owners (int64)
